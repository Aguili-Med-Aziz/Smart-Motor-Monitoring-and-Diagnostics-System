Overview
![PNG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76be1d0d-30d1-46dc-af1a-5a05d0f93156)

This project implements a complete smart monitoring solution for a 3-phase motor system using an Arduino microcontroller. The goal is to track voltage, current, vibration, and temperature to provide early diagnostics and preventative maintenance alerts. The system includes:

Voltage Measurement (up to 420V AC)

Current Measurement (non-invasive)

Temperature Sensing

Vibration and Motion Monitoring

Data Logging and IoT Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under development. Some hardware and software features are subject to improvement and optimization.

Features

Safe voltage measurement using voltage dividers

Current monitoring using the CSNB121 analog current sensor

Thermal monitoring with DS18B20

Vibration detection using MPU6050 IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)

Web dashboard for real-time visualization and alert generation

Powered by a high-capacity 5V Li-Ion 30,000mAh battery bank

üîß Planned Improvements:

Add over-the-air firmware update capability

Integrate edge AI for anomaly detection

Improve dashboard UI/UX and add historical data logging

Add support for Modbus/industrial protocol gateways
